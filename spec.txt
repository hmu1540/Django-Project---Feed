You will create a social media platform (like Instagram) based on the skills you are learning using Django. 
Be as creative as you can! Requirements are:

1) users should be able to register to create an account

2) They should be able to post images and captions

3) Allow approved users to view, comment and rate their images

This tutorial will be a help to upload images in Django - https://djangocentral.com/uploading-images-with-django/ (Links to an external site.)

Submit your GIT repository URL for building your MyInsta project. 
NOTE: you can 'submit' this assignment as soon as you have a repository. 
You can keep editing your project and updating the repository but the URL will still be the same.
